# New to R? Start here

If you're new to R and want to learn how to use it, this library might be a little daunting.

> There's so much choice! 

If you aren't sure where  to start, then try one  of these three options:

### Book: R for Data Science

This book is an excellent introduction to R programming and gets you started with visualizing data so you see some exciting stuff, and the power of R, right away. 

The book is free to read at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

There's an accompanying exercise solution book at https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/

For a different take on the solutions, check out *Yet another ‘R for Data Science’ study guide* which can also be found at https://brshallo.github.io/r4ds_solutions/

If you'd like more of a roadmap which incorporates this book, have a look at my blogpost:

### Video Course: Getting started with R

If you prefer video instruction with progress tracking, check out this course from "R for the Rest of Us" called Getting Started with R.

### Watch a data analyst code live

If you’re looking for real-world examples of live data analyses, you’ve come to the right place.

David Robinson, a highly experienced Data Scientist, has recorded many screencasts where he analyses data that he’s never seen before. These are fantastic examples of how to think about approaching an analysis. You couldn’t ask for a better mentor!

All analyses are done in R with over 80 hours of screencasts timestamped and annotated with detailed info.
